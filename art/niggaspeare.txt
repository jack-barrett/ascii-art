But wait, what's dat light in da window over dere? It iz da east, an' Juliet iz da sun. Rise up, fine sun, an' kill da jealous moon.
The moon iz already sick an' pale wiff grief cuz ya, Juliet, her maid, iz mo' fine than she. Don't be her maid, cuz she iz jealous.
Virginity makes her peep sick an' green. Only fools hold on ta they virginity. Let it jet. Oh, there's muh ma fuckin beotch!
Oh, it iz muh ma fuckin love. Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her. She's jivin', but she's not saying anyfin'.
So what? Her peeps iz saying sumfin. I will answer dem. I be too bold. She's not jivin' ta me.
Two o' da brightest stars in da whole sky had ta jet away on bidness, an' they're asking her peeps ta twinkle in they places until dey return.
What if her peeps wuz in da sky an' da stars wuz in her head? The brightness o' her cheeks would outshine da stars da way da sun outshines uh lamp.
If her peeps wuz in da night sky, dey would shine so brightly through space dat birds would start singing, thinking her light wuz da light o' day.
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek. Oh, I wish I wuz da glove on dat hand so dat I could whack dat cheek. what the fuck sup now?
