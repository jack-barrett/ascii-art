yes hello this is a big collection of unsorted asciis

some tips for proper ascii scrollage (in irssi alias format):

pump       exec -o cat ~/ascii/$0.txt | sed -e "s/^/ /"
find       exec ls ~/ascii/ | grep "$0"
test       exec cat ~/ascii/$0.txt
asciinum   exec -o echo "I GOT \$(ls ~/ascii | wc -l) ASCIIS BUT A BITCH 
AINT ONE"

obviously i'm guessing that you put the asciis in ~/ascii, change if you 
didn't

for ascii art design, use ircpaint at paint.irc.so or
